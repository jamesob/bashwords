	bashwords - a work in progress
    by jamesob

	* bashwords is a very minimal vocabulary trainer for the BASH
	  environment. It was designed with simplicity at the forefront.

	  Basically, all it does is affixes a pseudo-random vocabulary
	  word from a user(that's you)-defined dictionary to your
	  command prompt; e.g,

	  	analgesic|host:dir usr$
	  	apropos|host:dir usr$
	  	bucolic|host:dir usr$

	  Unsure of its meaning?

	  	analgesic|host:dir usr$ define
	      analgesic
	      Definition: acting to relieve pain
	      Synonyms: ['anesthetic', ' anodyne']
	  
	  Like to add a word?

	  	analgesic|host:dir usr$ addword
		Which word would you like to add?: ameliorate
		Its definition?: make something (bad or unsatisfactory) better
		Some synonyms? (delimit each with ','): enhance, alleviate 
		Word added. 4 total words in collection.

	  It has, by no means, been optimized for performance and I
	  won't be held liable if you ralph while browsing the source.

	* to install
		0. create a directory ~/.bashwords/
		1. move all files (configure.py, cycle.py, bashwords.py) 
		   into .bashwords/
		2. run configure.py
			-"python configure.py"
