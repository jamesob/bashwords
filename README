    bashwords - a work in progress
    by jamesob

    * bashwords is a very minimal vocabulary trainer for the BASH
      environment. It was designed with simplicity at the forefront.

      Basically, all it does is affixes a pseudo-random vocabulary
      word from a user-defined (that's you) dictionary to your
      command prompt; e.g,

        analgesic|host:dir usr$
        apropos|host:dir usr$
        bucolic|host:dir usr$

      Unsure of a word's meaning? Use "define".

        analgesic|host:dir usr$ define
        analgesic
        Definition: acting to relieve pain
        Synonyms: ['anesthetic', ' anodyne']
      
      Like to add a word? Use "addword".

        analgesic|host:dir usr$ addword
        Which word would you like to add?: ameliorate
        Its definition?: make something (bad or unsatisfactory) better
        Some synonyms? (delimit each with ','): enhance, alleviate 
        Word added. 4 total words in collection.

      How about deleting? Use "delword".

        analgesic|host:dir usr$ delword
        Word to delete: ameliorate
        Entry for 'ameliorate' successfully removed.

      List all words in dictionary with "lswords".

      Batch import words with "python bashwords.py fromFile".
      File format:
          [name of word]
          [definition]
          [synonyms]
          [blank line]

      Dump all words currently in bank to file with
      "python bashwords.py toFile". File comes in same format as above.

      ------------------------

      Bashwords has, by no means, been optimized for performance and I
      won't be held liable if you ralph while browsing the source.

    * to install
        (0. crack open setup.py and specify an install directory
            if you want somewhere other than the default, 
            "~/.bashwords/")
        1. run "python setup.py install"
